    "- age; Age of user. NOTE: comes in a string (convert to (int))\n",

    "Created class ```InsuranceAnalyzer```.\n",
    "-\tInitializing the class requires a call, in this case a CSV document.\n",
    "\n",
    "-\t```convert_strings_to_numbers``` takes a CSV as an args. This function is to convert the strings to numbers and floats for mathematical operations. Returns a list of dictionaries with numeric values converted from string to int or float.\n",
    "\n",
    "-\t```cost_of_smoking``` takes no args. This function finds and compares the average cost of insurance for smokers and non-smokers. Returns a formatted string stating the average cost for smoker and non-smokers, and the difference in cost between the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "-\t```calculate_median``` takes no args. Finds the median age of insured persons in the dataset. Returns int.\n",
    "\n",
    "-\t```insurance_above_below_median``` takes int as arg, ```ask_age```. Compares arg to median from ```calculate_median``` function. Returns string stating whether the ```ask_age``` is older, younger or same as median age.\n",
    "\n",
    "-\t```cost_by_region``` takes str as arg, ```region```: based on region, returns the average cost of all insured in that region. \n",
    "\n",
    "-\t```cost_by_age``` takes int as arg, ```age```: based on age, returns the average cost of all insured at that age.\n",
    "\n",
    "-\t```find_insured_user``` takes unspecified amount of keyword arguments, ```**kwargs``` each keyword represents a key from the dictionaries in the ```insurance_list```. Returns the users as a list of dictionaries based on ```**kwargs```\n",
    "\n",
    "-\t```avg_cost_by_user``` takes unspecified amount of keyword arguments, ```**kwargs``` each keyword represents a key from the dictionaries in the ```insurance_list```. Returns the average cost of insurance based on ```**kwargs```\n",
